NOTE: groovy code has been quickly converted from python and still needs to be adjusted, cleaned up, and optimized

Advantages of groovy over python:
* ~40% faster (for almost identical codepath)
* can be easily converted to use parallel processing (still TODO)
* more platform-independent
* integrating nicely with gradle
